# Mean_variance_calculator
This project is a Python program that performs basic statistical calculations (mean, variance, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and sum) on a 3x3 matrix using NumPy. The input is a list of nine numbers, which is then converted into a 3x3 matrix. The program returns a dictionary with the results of the calculations across rows, columns, and the entire matrix.
